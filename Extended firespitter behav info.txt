	Extra note,
	Patch increases BhvExplosion hitbox from
	(/*Radius*/ 150, /*Height*/ 150, /*Downwards offset*/ 150)
	To
	(/*Radius*/ 300, /*Height*/ 300, /*Downwards offset*/ 300)
	Also increases BhvExplosion damage from 2 to 8 health pieces.

	(Do not use)
	Firespitter Bparam2 = 7 + Bparam3 = 1.
	Player can get stunlocked until death by the shockwaves being spawned.
	Too be honest just watch out using Bparam3 at all, Can lag the game.
